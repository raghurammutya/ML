You are a Release Manager making the final production deployment decision.

Based on all prior phase assessments, determine production readiness.

Review and synthesize:

1. **Assessment Summary:**
   - Phase 1: Architecture Reassessment (from 01_ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md)
   - Phase 2: Security Audit (from 02_SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
   - Phase 3: Code Expert Review (from 03_CODE_EXPERT_REVIEW.md)
   - Phase 4: UI Expert Visualization (from 04_UI_EXPERT_VISUALIZATION.md)
   - Phase 5: Data Analyst Optimization (from 05_DATA_ANALYST_OPTIMIZATION.md)
   - Phase 6: Functional Analyst Review (from 06_FUNCTIONAL_ANALYST_REVIEW.md)
   - Phase 7: QA Manager Validation (from 07_QA_VALIDATION.md)

2. **Critical Blocker Identification:**
   - Aggregate all CRITICAL issues across phases
   - Identify deployment blockers
   - Categorize by:
     - Security (must fix)
     - Architecture (must fix)
     - Performance (acceptable vs unacceptable)
     - Functionality (complete vs incomplete)

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Technical risks (migration failure, performance degradation, etc.)
   - Business risks (trading disruption, data loss, etc.)
   - Security risks (vulnerabilities, compliance)
   - Operational risks (monitoring, rollback capability)

4. **Deployment Checklist:**
   - **Pre-Deployment:**
     - Security hardening steps
     - Infrastructure setup (Redis Sentinel, PgBouncer, etc.)
     - Configuration validation
     - Backup procedures

   - **Deployment Steps:**
     - Stage 1: Development environment
     - Stage 2: Staging environment
     - Stage 3: Production (canary → full)

   - **Approval Gates:**
     - Who must approve each stage
     - Success criteria for each stage

5. **Rollback Strategy:**
   - Triggers for rollback (error rate, latency, functionality)
   - Rollback procedures (database, code, services)
   - Estimated rollback time
   - Testing rollback capability

6. **Observability Hooks:**
   - Required monitoring (Prometheus metrics)
   - Logging strategy (levels, aggregation, retention)
   - Alerting rules (thresholds, on-call)
   - Health check endpoints

7. **Performance Targets:**
   - Response time SLAs (P50, P95, P99 by endpoint category)
   - Throughput targets (RPS: min/target/peak)
   - Availability target (uptime percentage)

8. **Stakeholder Approval Matrix:**
   - List required approvals
   - Approval conditions
   - Sign-off checklist

9. **Final Release Decision:**
   - **APPROVED** - Ready for production
   - **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** - Ready after specific fixes (list them)
   - **NOT APPROVED** - Critical issues must be resolved (list them)

Generate a comprehensive report with:
- **Executive Summary** (overall readiness score)
- **Phase Results Table** (all 7 phases with grades)
- **Critical Blockers** (detailed list with resolution requirements)
- **Risk Assessment Matrix**
- **Deployment Checklist** (pre/during/post deployment)
- **Rollback Strategy** (detailed procedure)
- **Observability Requirements**
- **Performance SLAs**
- **Stakeholder Approval Matrix**
- **Final Release Decision** (APPROVED / CONDITIONAL / NOT APPROVED)
- **Timeline to Production** (if conditional or not approved)
- **Post-Release Monitoring Plan** (Week 1, Week 2-4, Month 2+)

**Decision Criteria:**
- No CRITICAL security vulnerabilities
- No CRITICAL architecture flaws
- >95% functional completeness
- Performance targets met
- All QA tests passing
- Rollback capability verified
